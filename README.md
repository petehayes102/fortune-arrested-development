# Arrested Development quotes for Fortune

I lifted these quotes from [mandatory.com](http://www.mandatory.com/2013/05/22/the-100-greatest-quotes-from-arrested-development/) and formatted them for [fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_\(Unix\)).

## Installation

1. Copy the fortune file, *arresteddevelopment*, into the fortune directory. On CentOS, the path is */usr/share/games/fortune/*.
2. Convert the plain text file to a .dat:
```
strfile /usr/share/games/fortune/arresteddevelopment /usr/share/games/fortune/arresteddevelopment.dat
```
